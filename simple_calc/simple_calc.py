Simple calculator that will 
  - Take in two numbers from the user
  - Take in an operator from the user
  - Perform the mathematical operation and provide the number to the user
  - Repeat

Operations:
  - "+" : addition
  - "-" : subtraction
  - "*" : multiplication
  - "/" : division

Error conditions:
  - Invalid operator --> Program should exit
  - Invalid number   --> Program should exit
