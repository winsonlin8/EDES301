LED Driver

  This driver uses the flag "low_off" to determine if the LED is configured 
such that the LED is ON when the output is "High"/"1" and OFF when the output is 
"Low" / "0", i.e. "low_off=True", or that the LED is OF when the output is 
"High"/"1" and ON when the output is "Low" / "0", i.e. "low_off=False",

Software API:

  LED(pin, low_off=True)
    - Provide pin that the LED is connected
    
    is_on()
      - Return a boolean value (i.e. True/False) if the LED is ON / OFF

    on()
      - Turn the LED on

    off()
      - Turn the LED off
