This file provides an interface to a PWM controllered buzzer.
  - Ex:  https://www.adafruit.com/product/1536


APIs:
  - Buzzer(pin)
    - play(frequency, length=1.0, stop=False)
      - Plays the frequency for the length of time

    - stop(length=0.0)
      - Stop the buzzer (will cause breaks between tones)
      
    - cleanup()
      - Stop the buzzer and clean up the PWM
